        <h3>1. Secure Business Document Management Systems :</h3> 
            <p > This is my <b>final year project</b>, where I am crafting a sophisticated web-based 
              application designed to revolutionize the creation of business documents, 
              all while prioritizing security and user experience. At the heart of my project is a 
              commitment to robust security. I am implementing cutting-edge Two-Factor Authentication 
              to fortify our application's defenses, ensuring that your data remains protected at all times.              
              Moreover, I am taking proactive measures to safeguard your documents by generating it as a 
              password-protected PDF, that ensures confidentiality and integrity.
              
            <br> <br> Currently, this project is in the development stage, diligently refining 
            features and optimizing the user experience to deliver a seamless and intuitive 
            application that exceeds expectations.
            <br> <br> Stay tuned for updates on my progress as I work towards my anticipated completion date in
             <b>May 2024</b>.

            <h3>2. One-Stop-Service System:</h3> 
                <p > Developed an android-based application in a group of 4 
                  which serves as a platform that connects users and multiple 
                  service providers available throughout their nearest area. 
                  The project is still under testing phase. 
                  <br> <br> For this program, our members have segregated the tasks according to user
                  and service provider interface.
